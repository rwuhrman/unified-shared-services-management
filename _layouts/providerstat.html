<h2 style="font-family: arial"><strong>Data Driven Performance Management</strong></h2>
<span style="font-family: arial;font-size: 14px"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/1041/2016/07/providerstat.png" align="left" /> The promise of shared services is a government that delivers services to its citizens more effectively and efficiently because it spends less time and money on common administrative functions. USSM gathers critical performance data about shared service providers and customers, as well as upcoming demand, to guide decision making. Some of the performance management tools are:</span>
<p></p><BR>
<li><b>Metrics and Data Collection:</b> USSM collects and analyzes data from shared service providers to inform executive decision makers on the overall condition and performance of the shared services marketplace. Data sets include: provider demographics, common performance metrics, staffing, budget, systems Inventory, and information on contracts.

<p></p>
<li><b>Provider Best Practices:</b> USSM guides shared service providers through a self-assessment process where each provider ranks their performance against five key categories (financial, organizational, operational, program management, and technology) each with a number of customer and provider jointly approved elements.

<p></p>
<li><b>2017 Administrative Shared Services Provider Performance Assessment:</b> USSM seeks the shared service customer perspective through a satisfaction survey. The survey gathers feedback and ratings of customer experience over the past 12 months with shared service providers in Financial Management, Human Resources, and Payroll functions. In future years the survey may expand to additional service areas such as travel, grants, acquisitions, and information technology. Respondents include executives/directors, managers/supervisors, and end-users who regularly interface with the shared service providers as a routine job function. The survey provides confidential, constructive feedback for providers, policymakers and the shared services community at large.</li>
<p></p>
<span style="font-family: arial;font-size: 14px">This approach to data driven performance management empowers government leaders to make informed decisions about shared service strategy and service delivery, helps agencies compare their options based on cost and quality, and increases transparency.<br />
