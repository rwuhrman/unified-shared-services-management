 &nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Integrated Business Framework is a model that enables the Federal government to better coordinate and document common business needs across agencies and focus on outcomes, data, processes and performance. It is the essential first step towards standards that will drive economies of scale and leverage the government’s buying power.
